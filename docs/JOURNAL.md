# Naranxia journal

Newest first. One entry per batch or work session: what changed, what was verified, decisions, what is left.
Start of a session: read the top 2 entries and trust them (do not re-verify what is marked verified).
End of a batch: add an entry on top (3 to 10 lines), close the issues, keep CLAUDE.md in step if a rule or a tool changed.

- Batch 4 of the King's list of 2026-11-02 (the list is now complete): troops panel (F2 / army button, units by type and task,
  click to select), peasant tasks (Wood, Stone, Gold, Farm, Build in the peasant menu, `assignJob`), co-op convoys (castle menu >
  Co-op > Send: porters carry gold / wood / stone / food to the partner, dots on the map, refund after 120 s), Fire arrows research
  (Academy after Fletching: zombies burn 3 s, 6 + 0.2 x wave dps; swarm hits x1.35), selection label and unit names translated.
- Tools asked by the King ("met tout en place, consomme le moins possible, garde en mémoire chaque action"):
  `src/game.js` split into `src/game/00..22` (packed build byte-identical, checked with cmp), translations one per line + `tools/addtexts.py`,
  bug report F8 (+ Esc menu button) and `tools/repro.py` (loads the save in 1 s with the renderer stubbed), test mode F10 (solo, blocks achievements),
  `tools/test_all.sh`, GitHub CI `test.yml` (release.yml waits for it), `tools/release.sh`, `tools/ci_status.sh`, `tools/board.py`, this journal,
  GitHub issues as the backlog (labels + templates), CLAUDE.md "Working efficiently".
- Verified locally: smoke, det, tools, mp8, mpk, mp_resync, mp_convoy all PASS; convoy: 2 porters, 60 wood + 30 stone each, delivered at ticks 698 / 745
  on both machines, porters home, 1331 hash checks equal.
- Left: restyle of king, captain, bannerman, gunner, zombies, then buildings (issue, label restyle). Second player's placement and invisible
  buildings were never reproduced (identical in a real 2-client lobby test): waiting for an F8 report (label needs-report).

## 2026-11-05 · v88
- Co-op automatic resync: hash mismatch -> host freezes, sends its save in 48 KB chunks ('rs0'/'rs1'), guest loads, then host loads the same
  snapshot (`mpResApply`, seeded Math.random during the load), lockstep restarts at a new epoch (`MP.ep`); banner "Co-op: resynchronizing...".
- Desync cause fixed: zombies / AI units took `pl` from CURPL (differs per machine), now `pl:t===0?CURPL:0`.
- Verified: mp_resync RESULT OK (resync in 7-9 s), mp8 / mpk no divergence, det same.

## 2026-11-05 · v87
- Castle turned with R while placing (door check `castleRotAt`), partner's castle visible in the live picker (ghost, beam, name tag, cursor),
  distance rule reduced to "castles must not overlap" (`sitesFar` >= 10 tiles), castles no longer sink (`smChunk` keeps the pad height),
  units use ramps (`canStep` / `canStepZ`, TFL 1 levelled 2 miner 3 player-made), double click selects all buildings of a type + group upgrade,
  tower / castle range ring on click, "Quit game" (and "Exit to desktop" in the app), co-op version check, AI kingdoms and hordes treat both castles alike.
- Decisions: public repo; "versions directes"; CLAUDE.md + headless tests + release workflow with Discord post.

## Before v87 (restyle track, unreleased, in wip/restyle)
- Approved by the King: armour of knight / royal guard / archer / peasant in the Minecraft-skin style; knight shield B (Minecraft shield);
  royal guard shield "blason 1" (red pale, gold crown and sun); voxel halberd; shield pressed on the forearm (SHZ 1.35).
- Credit "Minecraft Shield" by bugbilly (CC BY 4.0) in the release notes when the shields ship. Never copy third-party models (crimson heir: style only).
